## Future

More tools are in the works! The Pynosaur ecosystem is actively growing with new explorations of classic Unix concepts.

Stay tuned for updates.

## Philosophy

Each pynosaur tool follows these principles:

1. **Pure Python** - Standard library only, keeping Python's purity alive
2. **Educational** - Learn by recreating classic Unix tools
3. **Exploratory** - Breathe fresh software into old concepts
4. **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
5. **Extendable** - Designed to be understood and modified
